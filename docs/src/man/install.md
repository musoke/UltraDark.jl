# Installation

First, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

To install and run tests, open the Julia REPL and enter pkg mode by pressing ].
```
$ julia

pkg> dev UltraDark.jl

pkg> test UltraDark
```
This may take a while to run.
There are a lot of packages to compile and some of the tests are of real simulations.

If the tests succeed, you're all set!

Next, check out the [`overview`](@ref Overview) or to jump to running the [example notebooks](https://github.com/musoke/UltraDark.jl/tree/main/examples) in [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).
